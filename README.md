# Easy Angular Polymorphism

This repository demonstrates the concept of polymorphism using Angular. Polymorphism is a fundamental object-oriented programming concept that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. In the context of Angular, it's a powerful tool for building flexible and extensible applications.

## What is Polymorphism?

Polymorphism allows different objects to be treated as instances of a common parent class, enabling more flexible and dynamic programming. In Angular, this often means creating a shared interface or base class for related components or services.

## Repository Structure

This repository contains an Angular application that showcases polymorphism through various shape components. The shape components (`CircleComponent`, `SquareComponent`, `RectangleComponent`) share a common interface (`Shape`), enabling them to be handled uniformly.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the repository directory.
3. Install the dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Run the Angular development server with `ng serve`.

## Key Features

- Demonstrates polymorphism in an Angular application.
- Shows how to create shared interfaces/classes for components.
- Uses Angular's template syntax to handle different types of shapes dynamically.

## Examples

In this application, you'll find examples of how polymorphism works with Angular components. The template uses Angular's `*ngSwitch` directive to conditionally render different shape components based on their type.
